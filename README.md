Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10+
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.13 (to build the provider plugin)

Developing the Provider
---------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (please check the [requirements](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws#requirements) before proceeding).

*Note:* This project uses [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) making it safe to work with it outside of your existing [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). The instructions that follow assume a directory in your home directory outside of the standard GOPATH (i.e `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`).

Clone repository to: `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/; cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-servicenowcmdb
...
```

Enter the provider directory and run `make tools`. This will install the needed tools for the provider.

```sh
$ make tools
```

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-servicenowcmdb
...
```

Using the Provider
----------------------
The majority of code for this provider is automatically generated using *Metadata* about each ServiceNow CMDB Configuration Item by pulling the Meta Data from ServiceNow and using *go templates* to generate the resource files.

Refer to the documentation on how the [build provider source files](https://github.com/philw764/terraform-provider-servicenowcmdb/tree/master/servicenowcmdb/generateprovidersource) utility functions. 
Testing the Provider
---------------------------
Testing of the ServiceNow CMDB has not been developed yet, this is one of the priorities now that the concept has been proven.  There is significant re-factoring required for this provider because I was learning coding in *go* at the same time.
In order to test the provider, you can run `make test`.

*Note:* A connection to a ServiceNow instance is required.  You can get a free developer instance at [developer.servicenow.com](https://developer.servicenow.com)
```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run. Please read [Running an Acceptance Test](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-an-acceptance-test) in the contribution guidelines for more information on usage.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

Contributing
---------------------------
Not really ready for contributors yet.

Issues on GitHub are intended to be related to bugs or feature requests with provider codebase. See https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/community/index.html for a list of community resources to ask questions about Terraform.
