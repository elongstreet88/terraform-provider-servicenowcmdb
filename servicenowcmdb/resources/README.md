# ServiceNow CMDB Provider for Terraform

*NOTE* All files in this directory except the following are automatically generated using the *buildresources* utility.
    - client_base.go

I really need to move client_base.go out of this directory so that all files are autogenerated.  I had an issue with circualar reference between the client_base.go and cmdb_ci.go file.

I'm still learning *go* so it's one of those things I'll pick up as I go along.

Things to do:

1.  Re-factor to move alot of the repetative structs and code into a common package.
2.  Write test cases
3.  Create Data Providers for often used ServiceNow tables (ie location, group, user etc)
